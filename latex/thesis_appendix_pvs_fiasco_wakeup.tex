% In Fiasco IPC it is possible to have a combined send- and receive call, which
% means that after a sender has sent its message to the receiver. It then waits
% for that receiver to send a message back to him. After the sender has sent
% its message, it thus enters a receiving state. Simultaneously the receiver 
% enters a sending state. Now the sender has to wait for the receiver to
% send its message. It is therefore important that the receiver is ready to be
% scheduled, otherwise the sender might be waiting forever for the receiver to 
% send a message back. The receiver being ready to be scheduled is controlled
% by a single bit, namely the <thread_ready> bit that thus has to be set when
% the receiver switches to the sending status.

  % When the sender- and receiver are still engaged in IPC after the send part
  % has finished, the receiver should be in a state ready to be scheduled which
  % means that the <thread_ready> bit of the receiver should be set.
