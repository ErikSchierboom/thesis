\section{Verification attempts}
In this chapter we will discuss our verification attempts. Earlier, we listed the properties we attempted to prove. Here we will give the formal definition of each property we tried to prove. As the model and the properties were directly tied to each other, most properties required alterations to the model. These will be discussed along with the problems encountered during the verification.
